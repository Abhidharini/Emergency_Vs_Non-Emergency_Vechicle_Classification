Emergency Vs Non-Emergency Vehicle Classification using Deep Learning Models


This repository contains code and resources for implementing a vehicle image classification system that differentiates between emergency and non-emergency vehicles using deep learning models.

## Overview
The project aims to provide a solution for efficient traffic management and emergency response systems by automatically classifying vehicles into two categories: emergency and non-emergency. The system can be integrated into traffic monitoring systems to aid in real-time decision-making, optimize traffic flow, and prioritize emergency responses.

## Methodology
We employ various deep learning models such as DenseNet, ResNet, Xception, and MobileNetV2 for vehicle classification. The models are trained on labeled image data, and extensive data augmentation techniques are used to enhance model performance and prevent overfitting.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains datasets or links to datasets used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Includes scripts for creating, training, and evaluating the deep learning models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process.

## Instructions
1. Obtain the dataset or provide the dataset link and organize it in the `data/` directory.
2. Train the deep learning models using the scripts in the `models/` directory.
3. Evaluate the models and visualize the results.
4. Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters for improved performance.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to suit your specific use case. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.
